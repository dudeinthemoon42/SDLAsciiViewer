# SDLAsciiViewer

A program that converts .gifs into colored ascii versions, written in C using libcaca.
You can even use the program as a screen saver generator. Just change the file extension on the executable to a .scr, then set it as your screen saver by right clicking on it. If you are on Windows 10, you might have to change a setting that hides the file extensions and enable it to show them. Once you've done that, download and run a program called 'MonitorES' (and set it to run on Windows start), and test your screen saver by going to the lock screen. To exit the screen saver, just press the Q key.
